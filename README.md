# AI-Assisted Oral Cancer Screening Web App

![Application Screenshot](assets/images/ReadmeImage.png)

**Empowering early detection through AI-driven oral health screening**

This web application provides an intelligent, user-friendly interface for screening oral cavity images using deep learning model (YOLO-based). It assists clinicians and community health workers in detecting oral abnormalities such as Benign Lesions, Oral Potentially Malignant Disorders (OPMD), and Oral Cavity Carcinoma (OCA) — directly from uploaded or live-captured images.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Detection** – Real-time analysis using YOLO deep learning models

- **Multiple Input Modes**
  - **Single Image Mode** – Upload and analyze one image.
  - **Batch Analysis Mode** – Upload multiple images or a ZIP folder for bulk screening.
  - **Live Mode** – Capture directly via webcam or iPhone Continuity Camera.

- **Automatic Report Generation** – Generates color-coded risk assessments and downloadable medical PDF reports.

- **Bilingual Support** – English report text with Nepali impressions and visual guidance.

- **Batch Export** – Download all findings as CSV or PDF in one click.

- **Interactive Visualization** – Displays annotated images highlighting detected lesions.

## Installation Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd Oral-Cancer-Screening
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
# For Mac/Linux

## AI Model Details

- **Model Type:** YOLOv8 (custom trained for oral lesion detection)
- **Classes:** Healthy, Benign, OPMD, OCA
- **Frameworks Used:** PyTorch, OpenCV, Streamlit, ReportLab
- **Device Support:** GPU (CUDA) & CPU fallback

---

## Example Output

| AI Diagnosis | Confidence | Risk Assessment | Clinical Recommendation |
|-------------|------------|----------------|------------------------|
| Oral Cavity Carcinoma | 96.7% | High Risk | Immediate oncology consultation |
| OPMD | 84.3% | Medium Risk | Specialist referral and biopsy consideration |
| Benign Lesion | 92.1% | Low Risk | Routine follow-up recommended |
| Healthy | 99.2% | No Risk | Maintain oral hygiene |

---

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| Frontend | Streamlit |
| AI Engine | YOLOv8 (PyTorch) |
| Image Processing | OpenCV, NumPy, PIL |
| Report Generation | ReportLab |
| Data Management | Pandas |
| Deployment | Localhost / Streamlit Cloud / Custom Server |

---

## Generated Reports

Each analysis automatically generates:

- Annotated lesion image
- Clinical summary (Diagnosis, Risk, Referral)
- English + Nepali impression
- Downloadable PDF report

---

## Configuration

All configuration is centralized in `app/config.py`:
- Model paths
- Class names and mappings
- Color schemes for visualization
- Default confidence and IoU thresholds
- Referral and risk assessment mappings

---

## Usage Notes

- Ensure `best.pt` model file is in `assets/models/`
- All paths are relative and cross-platform compatible
- The application supports both CPU and GPU inference
- For best performance, use GPU (CUDA) when available
